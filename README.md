Acsys5K - Track Your Runs!
=================================================================

An app to track your runs and compete with your friends.

This is an app that we used at our office (Primacy) to raise awareness about the benefits and importance of exercise and team work. This is an AppEngine-built Python project that can be run either on AppEngine or any other Python WebApp environment.

The app contains a very basic data structure to keep track of the runs that people log and also has rather a rudimentary security mechanism to authenticate users. To access the app all you need is URL and Base64 Encoded username, e.g. http://<my domain>/?u=Z2xlYnA= (the "Z2xlYnA=" is a base64 encoded username). There's no password. The app also provides quick metrics and dashboards. Screenshots below.
