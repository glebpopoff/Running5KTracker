Acsys5K - An App to Track Your Runs and Compete With Your Buddies
=================================================================

This is an app that we used at our office (Primacy) to raise awareness about the benefits and importance of exercise and team work. This is an AppEngine-built Python project that can be run either on AppEngine or any other Python WebApp environment.

The app contains a very basic data structure to keep track of the runs that people log and also has rather a rudimentary security mechanism to authenticate users. To access the app all you need is URL and Base64 Encoded username, e.g. http://<my domain>/?u=Z2xlYnA= (the "Z2xlYnA=" is a base64 encoded username). There's no password. The app also provides quick metrics and dashboards. Screenshots below.
